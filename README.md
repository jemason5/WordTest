WordTest
========

A program which, given a dictionary, generates two output files, 'sequences' and 'words'. 
'sequences' contains every sequence of four letters that appears in exactly one word of the dictionary, 
one sequence per line. 'words' contains the corresponding words that contain the sequences, in the 
same order, again one per line.

Files:

1) wordText.pl:  main executable script file.
2) SequenceWord.pm:  class is used to hold simple statistics of a sequence.
3) dictionaryFile.txt: sample dictionary file
